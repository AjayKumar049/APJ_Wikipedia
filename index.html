        <hr>
        <p class="p1"><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served 
            as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in <a href="">Rameswaram,</a>  <a href="">Tamil Nadu</a> and studied <a href="">physics</a> and <a href="">aerospace engineering.</a> He spent the 
            next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and  military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the 
           <b>Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of <a href="">ballistic missile</a> and <a href="">launch vehicle</a> technology.<sup>[2][3][4]</sup> He also played a pivotal organisational,technical, and 
            political role in India's <a href="">Pokhran-II</a> nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<sup>[5]</sup>

        <h2>Early life and education</h2><hr>
        <p class="p2">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a <a href="">Tamil Muslim</a> family in the pilgrimage centre of <a href="">Rameswaram</a> on <a href="">Pamban Island,</a> then in the 
            Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;<sup>[9]</sup> his mother Ashiamma 
            was a housewife.<sup>[10][11][12][13]</sup> His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
            Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.<sup>[16][17][18]</sup> His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous 
            properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
             poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders 
            and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between 
            the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the 
            mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.<sup>[19][20][21]</sup></p>
        <p class="p3">
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his 
studies, especially mathematics.<sup>[21]</sup> After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint 
Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. <sup>[22]</sup> He moved to Madras in 1955 to study 
aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.<sup>[13]</sup> While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress 
and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".<sup>[23]</sup> He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
 ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.<sup>[24]</sup></p>
